### PyData London two-day bootcamp study materials

This repository should help you prepare for and participate in the
PyData London bootcamp. To get the most out of this two-day workshop
you should set aside time to make sure that the laptop you bring
is ready to take you straight into the class materials.

**Please make sure you take this time, as doing so will ensure that you
aren't left behind right at the start!**

After participating in this workshop you should be able to:

* Understand the relationship between Python, Jupyter and various toolkits
* Create conda virtual environments and install packages in them
* Apply Python libraries to solve problems in Jupyter notebooks
